# Enron_Analytics
JPMC Data Scientist Assessment 

I chose the CHALLENGE 1: NLP

Tasks required to do in this Assessment:


"""This is a cleaned up version of a subset of the Enron emails. https://www.kaggle.com/loryn808/truncated-enron

Can you create data from the Enron emails for analysis?  Feel free to do any data  viz you think may be necessary.
Example:

How many emails were sent and received over a span of time (maybe on a per week or a per month bucket) for a particular email address?

What are the most commonly mentioned topic in the email body?  Topic could be a person, company/org, event,  significant noun phrases, etc.

The above are just suggestions.  Feel free to be creative. You can also extract other items from the emails that you think will be useful.

Can you think of use cases where this data might be useful?
Example:

Can you use this data set to predict who the possible email sender is?

Can you use this data set to classify an email to a certain topic?

The above are just suggestions.  Feel free to be creative."""
